  interactive version of the game
    - two plays playing on the same computer
      - player 1: x
      - player 2: o

  while no winner
   - loop between player one and player two
    - each playerplaces a token
    - games check if the player has won after each go


  Winning conditions:
    any four tokens in a row
      - any direction (including diagonals)

      [
